I'm a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Bar-Ilan University, advised by Prof. [Ido Dagan](https://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~dagan/) and Prof. [Jacob Goldberger](http://www.eng.biu.ac.il/goldbej/). Prior to that, I received my M.Sc in Electrical Engineering, under the supervision of Prof. [David Burshtein](https://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~burstyn/), and my B.Sc in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, both from Tel-Aviv University.

My research mainly deals with building and exploring advanced infrastructure for multi-document and lexical semantics tasks in NLP. My broader research interests include topics in deep representation learning and their applications for natural language processing, AI explainability and interpretability, information and coding theory, and recommender systems.
