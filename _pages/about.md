I'm a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Bar-Ilan University, advised by Prof. [Ido Dagan](https://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~dagan/) and Prof. [Jacob Goldberger](http://www.eng.biu.ac.il/goldbej/). Prior to that, I received my M.Sc in Electrical Engineering, under the supervision of Prof. [David Burshtein](https://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~burstyn/), and my B.Sc in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, both from Tel-Aviv University.

My research interests include topics in deep representation learning and their applications for natural language processing, information and coding theory, and recommender systems.
